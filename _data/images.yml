# it is possible to refer to images in front matter and access these images. 
# Or you can choose to just type them in the front matter. It is a matter of preference. 
# If you reuse images a lot, it can be convinent to only have them one place.

# So in your frontmatter you can either use this data file :
# background:  "{{ site.data.images.placeholder1800.src }}"
# imageLicense: "{{ site.data.images.placeholder1800.caption }}"
#
# or you can just type it in that file
